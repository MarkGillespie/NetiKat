# NetiKat

This repository uses git submodules. To clone, run `git clone [URL] --recursive`.

To build, run
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j7
```

This creates a folder `bin` with the executables inside the build directory. There is `bin/run` to run the code and `bin/test` to run the tests.
